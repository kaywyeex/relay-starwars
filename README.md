## **relay-starwars**

This small example was built on a custom CRA bootstrap, with the starwars
example from Facebook in mind.

It attempts to showcase the basic setup required when running and using relay
with an express backend, wrapping an external rest API.

To see it in action, you need to install the package, followed by running
`start:dev`. The files that need to be generated by the relay script have been
created in advance.

#### **The Backend**

* Json-server api
* Express-graphql http server wrapping the json api
* Schema with relay specific connectionType and globalIds
* Mutations with basic client-store updating
  * Create
  * Delete

#### **The Frontend**

* Retro SW theme (ofc)
* Simple usage example of
  * Environment
  * QueryRenderer
  * Mutations
